#  Sanity checks
###  accompanying scripts
This folder contains all scripts of tests of basic validity tests of package PsyFuns + all resulting data.

The folders of contain two sanity tests. Scripts used by both are very alike, therefore we will describe them together. All scripts and data are marked with name obs for tests of number of observations and noise, for tests with different levels of noise intensity.   

Scripts included:

1. gen_sc_[obs|noise].R - script for generating simulated experiments data
1. fit_sc_[obs|noise].R - script for estimating psychometric function parameters with different psychometric functions based  on simulated experiment data
1. res_sc_[obs|noise].R - analysing results of fits compared to original generating functions - ANOVA test of the claim and visualization of results

###Data
All resulting data from each phase of experimnet can be found in [osf repository]:https://osf.io/3qbkf/?view_only=d7fc8e53758f4afa9bbaa30d1df627fb .
