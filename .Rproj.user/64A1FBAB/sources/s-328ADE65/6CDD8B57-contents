#  Robustness of five usually used psychometric functions 
###  accompanying scripts
This folder contains all scripts to compare five psychometric functions in their ability to fit psychometric data.

Scripts included:

1. gen_funsComp.R - script for generating simulated experiments data
1. fit_funsComp.R - script for estimating psychometric function parameters with different psychometric functions based  on simulated experiment data
1. res_funsComp.R - analysing results of fits compared to original generating functions - ANOVA test of the claim and visualization of results - all conducted for sets of parameters and factors as declared in the thesis

###Data
All resulting data from each phase of experimnet can be found in [osf repository]:https://osf.io/3qbkf/?view_only=d7fc8e53758f4afa9bbaa30d1df627fb .
