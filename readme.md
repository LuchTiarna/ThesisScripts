#  Analysis of Robustness of the Psychometric functions
###  accompanying scripts

This repository contains all scripts explicitly used to simulate, process and analyse data for thesis Analysis of Robustness of the Psychometric functions. It includes all scripts used to generate illustrations and script for computation of experiment sampling schemes in the thesis as well.
For running all mentioned scripts use package PsyFuns.
List of included parts:

1. Sanity checks - tests for basic validity tests of package PsyFuns + all resulting data - folder SanityChecks
1. Function comparison - scripts used to compare five psychometric functions + all resulting data - folder FunctionComparison
1. Illustrations - Includes all scripts used to generate illustrations of the thesis
1. Sampling schemes - AFC - script used to compute sampling schemes for specified function based on Hill advice (see Hill [2001])
